Hi, I’m a Web Developer with over 5 years of hands-on experience, mainly working with WordPress, front-end development, and website optimization. I enjoy making websites faster, more secure, and easier for people to use.

Along with web development, I also have 4+ years of graphic design experience. I’ve created everything from animations and business cards to academic posters; some of which were even showcased at major conferences.

In addition, I’ve spent about 2 years managing social media for different platforms, helping businesses and organizations grow their online presence. CompTIA A+ certified. A strong background in network security, IT support, and help desk environments.
